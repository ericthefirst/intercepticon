## Intercepticon

A space-shooter game written in Processing to help middle-school students develop intuition for the slope-intercept form of a line.
To make it compatible with Processing.js, I changed about five lines of code.  Currently just a prototype; you can play it [here](http://www.threerightangles.com/intercepticon/).
